## âš¡ Running the application
Since it uses ECMAScript modules, to run the application you will need a server. It might not be possible to run the application directly from the file system just by opening the **index.hmtl** file.

Instead try using Live Preview or a similar VSCode extension and preview the **index.html** file.
